# ReservableRooms 

#### This addon allows you to create a reservable spot anywhere in the map.

## Features:

Claiming: Claiming a room, will result in you getting that room if there are no players or props that arent yours in the room.
This also automatically adds players on your prop protection buddy list to the allowed players in the room.
Unclaiming completely wipes the allowed players from the room, meaning it is free to claim again, no it does not delete props or anything inside.

Buddies: Claiming a room will give your prop protection buddy list access to the room too, on most servers this means admins as well.

Door locking: Doors automatically close and lock upon claiming the room with the door, doors unlock upon user confirmation or unclaiming/leaving.

###### Bugs will be fixed if reported, in a time frame at least.

###### Do not claim this addon as yours.

## Chat commands:

!claim ID ( Claims the requested spot if everything is a-ok )

!clear ID ( Clears the allowed player list for that spot ( Admin+ only command ))

!lockdoor ( Locks your door if you have a reserved room )

!rrv ( Returns server version of ReservableRooms )

!unclaim ( Unclaims a spot if you own it ( Does not require ID ))

!unlockdoor ( Unlocks your door if you have a reserved room )

## F.A.Q.

> Does this support buddy lists?

Yes.

> Will a 500 prop car being removed lag the server?

Depends on the server.
 
> What do I need to use this addon?

A CPPI complient prop protection, and a setup map file.

> Who made this addon?

I (Bkamahl/BabyBear) single handedly coded this addon with the help of the Gmod Wiki and some Facepunch threads and some friends.

> Why did you make this?

So people on advanced building servers can't be annoyed while building, if they wanted. 

> Where do I report bugs?

Either make an issue on GitHub or contact me on Steam(id/Bkamahl).

V7: Removed some useless brackets, and removed a couple lines that could possibly cause some rare problems.

V8: Replaced a couple if statements with one optimizing the check if player asking to claim is in the room hopefully fixing weird error on some servers that does not allow players to claim a room while in it.

V10: Added if not nil to start touch so that PA mirror's work and may solve issues with other addons too.

V11: Merge from WizardLizard to silently kill players instead of normally killing them leading to ragdoll and death sound.

V12: Made hook names more unique to make conflict with other addons more rare, you can now only claim a room if it is empty, you are in it, or if there are props in it and they are yours.

V13: Made ReservableRooms ignore world or null owner props, added !rrv to retrieve the servers ReservableRooms version, and changed order of which ReservableRooms entity handles props.

Allot can be optimized currently, with what I have recently found out, but I will save that for a later update.

V19: Updated !claim feedback to tell you the door is already locked

V20: Complete recode, no need for map editing, use command to add rooms, switched to hints.

V21: Fixed uppercase letters in dir so that GMod doesn't do big gey.

V22: Added timer before calling functions to create rooms on server to see if this will fix a rare case, added removal or map created reservablerooms for previous users, and moved initpostentity hook to bottom to see if that will fix anything.
