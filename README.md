# ReservableRooms 

#### This addon allows you to create a reservable spot anywhere in the map, if you are able to edit the map and add the entity.

## .A.Q.

Q: Does this support buddy lists? A: Yes.

Q: Will a 500 prop car being removed lag the server? A: Depends on the server.
 
Q: What do I need to use this addon? A: A CPPI complient prop protection, and a map with the entities.

Q: Who all made this addon? A: I (Bkamahl/BabyBear) single handedly coded this addon with the help of the Gmod Wiki and some 
Facepunch threads.

Q: Why did you make this? A: So people on advanced building servers can't be annoyed while building, if they wanted. 

Q: Where do I report bugs? A: Either make an issue on GitHub or contact me on Steam(id/Bkamahl) or Discord(BabyBear#5785).

Q: What is the entity called? A: "reservableroom".

## Instructions:

In hammer, on your map, create a block with the tools/toolstrigger texture

While the block is selected use Ctrl + T to create an entity

Turn smart edit off and when selecting the entity class, clear and type reservableroom

Then create a key called "RID" ( All caps ), then give it a value between 1 (one) through whatever number you want

## Serverside Config:

To change the "[ReservableRooms]" color, find the Color() at lines 10 for the server file and 7 for the entity file.
