ReservableSpots allows you to create a reservable spot anywhere in the map, if you are able to edit the map and add the entity.

Chat commands:
!claim ID ( Claims the requested spot if everything is a-ok )

!unclaim ( Unclaims a spot if you own it ( Does not require ID ))

!clear ID ( Clears the allowed player list for that spot ( Admin+ only command ))

!refreshfriends ( Rechecks your friends list ( Prop protection buddy list ) and adds or removes them to your spot if you own one. )

F.A.Q.
Q: Does this support buddy lists? A: Yes.
Q: Will a 500 prop car being removed lag the server? A: Depends on the server. 
Q: What do I need to use this addon? A: A CPPI complient prop protection, and a map with the entities.
Q: Who all made this addon? A: I (Bkamahl/BabyBear) single handedly coded this addon with the help of the Gmod Wiki and some Facepunch threads.
Q: Why did you make this? A: So people on advanced building servers can't be annoyed while building, if they wanted. 
Q: Where do I report bugs? A: Either make an issue on GitHub or contact me on Steam(id/Bkamahl) or Discord(BabyBear#5785).
Q: What is the entity called? A: "reservableroom".

Instructions:
In hammer, on your map, create a block with the tools/toolstrigger texture

While the block is selected use Ctrl + T to create an entity

Turn smart edit off and when selecting the entity class, clear and type reservableroom

Then create a key called "RID" ( All caps ), then give it a value between 1 (one) through whatever number you want
